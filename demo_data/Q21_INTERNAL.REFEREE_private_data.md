# Q21 Internal - Referee Private Data (Demo)

This file contains the SECRET answers that players are trying to guess.
This data is NEVER exposed to players - it's used internally for scoring.

## Secret Data

```json
{
  "actual_opening_sentence": "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.",
  "actual_associative_word": "green"
}
```

## Scoring Notes

- **Opening Sentence**: The exact first sentence of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
- **Associative Word**: "green" - representing the iconic green light at the end of Daisy's dock

Players' guesses are compared against these values to calculate their scores.
