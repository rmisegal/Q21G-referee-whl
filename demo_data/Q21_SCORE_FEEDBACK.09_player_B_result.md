  },
  "feedback": {
    "opening_sentence": "Your guess showed some understanding of the novel's themes but missed the specific opening structure. The Great Gatsby begins with a first-person reflection on advice received, establishing Nick as our narrator. The introspective quality you identified is present, but the actual first sentence focuses on vulnerability and paternal guidance rather than the broader themes you mentioned.",
    "associative_word": "Your color choice was reasonable but not the primary symbolic color in this novel. While your justification showed knowledge of the book, the green light at the end of Daisy's dock is the most iconic color symbol, representing Gatsby's unreachable dreams and the promise of the American Dream itself."
