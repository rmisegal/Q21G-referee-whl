  "feedback": {
    "opening_sentence": "Your guess captured the reflective tone of the opening, though the exact phrasing differs. The novel begins with Nick Carraway recounting advice from his father about reserving judgment. Your approach showed understanding of the narrative voice and introspective quality that defines the book's opening. Consider how the vulnerability mentioned sets up the entire story's themes of observation and moral complexity in the Jazz Age.",
    "associative_word": "Good association with the color domain. The green light is indeed a central symbol in the novel, representing Gatsby's hopes and dreams. Your justification demonstrated awareness of the symbolic importance of color throughout the narrative, particularly how green represents both envy and aspiration in the context of the American Dream."
